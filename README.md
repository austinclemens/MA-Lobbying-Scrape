# MA-Lobbying-Scrape
Tool for scraping amount of lobbying on bills before the MA legislature. This a project I was really excited about that just dropped off my radar at some point. MA has a really powerful disclosure law on lobbying that lets you see exactly which bills each lobbyist was interested in, whether they supported or opposed that bill, and how much money they spent on it. I had a number of ideas about this - just looking at the distributions would be interesting I think. I have no idea if the scraper still works and I think even at the time it had some problems. Bills in the MA legislature sometimes take strange paths to passage, getting appended to other bills and etc, and I'm pretty sure that when I stopped working on this there were some edge cases that the scraper did not handle correctly. The basic idea was for it to get data on a bill, and if there was no sign that the bill was passed or killed, to follow it down the tree until passage or ultimate defeat was found. There is also data in this project. I have no idea what all is in there or if it is all correct.
